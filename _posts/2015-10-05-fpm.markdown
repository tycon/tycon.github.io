If you are ever into making debian packages to distribute your
software, check out this great package management tool called
[fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/wiki) by
[@jordansissel](https://github.com/jordansissel). FPM is no-nonsense
package manager that lets you create packages by simply specifying
dependencies, and source and destination paths for your binaries,
libraries and includes.

### Example ###

Let us say you want to make a debian package to distribute the first
version of your `hello-dev` application, that provides a binary
(`hello`), a dynamic library (`libhello.so`) and an include file
(`hello.h`), which you want to be installed in the usual locations
under `/usr`. Also, let's assume that your application requires `gcc`
version 4.6.3 or above.  Creating a debian package for your is as easy
as:

     fpm -s dir -t deb -n "hello-dev" -v 1.0 --description "Hello development tools" -d 'gcc > 4.6.3' ./hello=/usr/bin/hello ./libhello.so=/usr/lib/libhello.so ./hello.h=/usr/include/hello.h ./LICENSE=/usr/share/doc/hello-dev/copyright

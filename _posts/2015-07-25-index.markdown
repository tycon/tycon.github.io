### Welcome to Quelea's home
Quelea is a Haskell library that is intended to simplify programming with
eventually consistent NoSQL stores, such as Cassandra. Among other things, the
library implements:

+ A high-level logic-based DSL that lets NoSQL application programmers
  declare the consistency requirements of their applications as
  _contracts_, 
+ A static contract classification procedure that maps high-level
  application contracts to appropriate low-level store consistency
  guarantees, and 
+ A run-time that runs application operations after tuning the store
  consistency to appropriate levels as determined by the contract
  classification procedure.  

While the implementations of DSL and the static contract classification
components are largely independent of the actual NoSQL store used, the current
implementation of run-time component is tailor-made to work with the Cassandra
data store. 

For further details, and to understand the theory behind Quelea, please read
our [PLDI paper](http://gowthamk.github.io/docs/quelea.pdf).
